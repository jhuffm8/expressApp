Part 1: Routes, Templates, and Views

    Choose a view engine: Decide between Pug, Mustache, or EJS based on research and personal preference.
    Create two different view templates using the chosen view engine.
    Implement navigation within views to switch between them.
    Include a basic form in one view for sending a POST request to a route.
    Implement route parameters in at least one route.

Part 2: Middleware

    Create a custom middleware function to log specific request data or research and implement third-party middleware for a practical purpose.
    Test the middleware to ensure it functions as expected within the application.

Part 3: Exploring Response Options

    Serve a locally stored image using Express static middleware.
    Create a "download" button in one of the views.
    Implement a route that responds to the download button click using res.download() to allow users to download the image.
